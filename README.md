## About Me

- **Background**: I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics at Northeastern University, with a GPA of 3.8. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, where I achieved a GPA of 6.5.
- **Skills**: My technical skills include Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, Java, C, and various databases such as MySql, MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite, and IBM DB2. I am proficient in tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Microsoft Office Suite (PowerPoint, Word, Excel), as well as SAS for data analysis.
- **Interests**: I am particularly interested in predictive analytics, data visualization, and probability & statistics. I enjoy exploring diverse datasets and extracting meaningful patterns and insights from them.

## Projects and Contributions

- **Analysis & Data Visualization of TBI Patient Data**: Leveraged SQL queries to extract relevant data from a large relational database of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Utilized matplotlib & seaborn libraries to create informative visualizations, enabling healthcare providers to identify patterns & trends in TBI recovery outcomes.
- **Breast Cancer Risk Prediction**: Developed a machine learning model using Python, pandas, numpy, and sci-kit-learn to predict the risk of breast cancer with 90% accuracy, contributing to early detection. Utilized SQL and relational databases to preprocess and analyze a dataset of patient demographics and medical records, resulting in improved data integrity and accuracy.
