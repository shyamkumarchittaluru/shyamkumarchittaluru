Hello, I'm Shyam Kumar Chittaluru, a dedicated and motivated data analyst with over 2 years of experience in driving process efficiency and data integrity. I have a strong background in leading teams for data mining and data warehousing solutions, and I am passionate about transforming data into actionable insights.

## About Me

- **Background**: I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics at Northeastern University, with a GPA of 3.8. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological 
                  University, where I achieved a GPA of 6.5.
- **Skills**: My technical skills include Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, Java, C, and various databases such as MySql, MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite, and IBM DB2. I am proficient in tools like Power BI, Tableau, and 
              Microsoft Office Suite (PowerPoint, Word, Excel), as well as SAS for data analysis.
- **Interests**: I am particularly interested in predictive analytics, data visualization, and probability & statistics. I enjoy exploring diverse datasets and extracting meaningful patterns and insights from them.

## Projects and Contributions

- **Analysis & Data Visualization of TBI Patient Data**: Leveraged SQL queries to extract relevant data from a large relational database of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Utilized matplotlib & seaborn libraries to                                                            create informative visualizations, enabling healthcare providers to identify patterns & trends in TBI recovery outcomes.
- **Breast Cancer Risk Prediction**: Developed a machine learning model using Python, pandas, numpy, and sci-kit-learn to predict the risk of breast cancer with 90% accuracy, contributing to early detection. Utilized SQL                                         and relational databases to preprocess and analyze a dataset of patient demographics and medical records, resulting in improved data integrity and accuracy.
- **Insurance Claims Fraud Detection**: Drove the redevelopment of the fraud detection algorithm, introducing 15+ new attributes, resulting in a decreased false positive cases by 85%. Analyzed customers' spending behavior,                                          including mapping the location of the spenders to identify fraudulent transactions from non-fraudulent ones, increasing the accuracy rate by over 90%.
