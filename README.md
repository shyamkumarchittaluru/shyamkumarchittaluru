## About Me

- **Background**: I combine healthcare domain expertise with strong technical skills in data engineering. My journey from Junior Data Engineer to specialized Clinical Data Engineer has given me a comprehensive understanding of enterprise data ecosystems. I'm particularly focused on building reliable, scalable data pipelines that maintain HIPAA compliance while enabling powerful analytics.
- **Skills**: My technical toolkit includes Python, PySpark, SQL (Oracle PL/SQL, T-SQL, PostgreSQL), and big data technologies (Spark, Hadoop, Kafka). I'm proficient with cloud platforms including AWS (S3, Lambda, EMR, Glue, RDS) and GCP, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), ETL/ELT tools (Airflow, NiFi, dbt), and BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, QlikView). I also have expertise in healthcare data standards (FHIR, HL7) and CI/CD practices.
- **Interests**: I'm passionate about data mesh architectures, data quality frameworks, and the intersection of healthcare and data engineering. I enjoy optimizing big data workflows and implementing modern data governance practices that maintain security while enabling self-service analytics.

## Projects and Contributions

- **Analysis & Data Visualization of TBI Patient Data**: Leveraged SQL queries to extract relevant data from a large relational database of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Utilized matplotlib & seaborn libraries to create informative visualizations, enabling healthcare providers to identify patterns & trends in TBI recovery outcomes.
- **Healthcare Analytics Data Pipeline**: Architected data integration from 12+ disparate clinical systems processing 2TB+ monthly data with a HIPAA-compliant governance framework. Built real-time processing pipelines using Apache Kafka and Spark for critical patient monitoring, resulting in improved patient outcomes and $3.2M in annual cost savings.
- **Data Quality Framework Implementation**: Engineered data quality frameworks with Great Expectations and Python scripts, achieving 92% accuracy across 14 clinical systems. Created comprehensive validation rules that significantly reduced integration errors in production dashboards.
- **Protocol Amendment Workflow Automation**: Streamlined protocol amendment workflows via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines and PL/SQL, cutting validation time from 4 days to 6 hours and improving team productivity.
- **Digital Advertising Analytics Platform**: Designed and implemented an end-to-end digital advertising performance analytics data pipeline modeled after major social media platforms. Created a real-time streaming solution with Kafka and Spark Streaming to process ad click events at scale (>10,000 events/second).
- **ETL Data Pipeline for Environmental Compliance Prediction (Dec 2024)**: Designed an ETL pipeline leveraging ArcGIS and Google Earth Engine to process geospatial data for environmental compliance prediction, reducing manual analysis time by 40%.
- **Breast Cancer Risk Prediction**: Developed a machine learning model using Python, pandas, numpy, and sci-kit-learn to predict the risk of breast cancer with 90% accuracy, contributing to early detection. Utilized SQL and relational databases to preprocess and analyze a dataset of patient demographics and medical records, resulting in improved data integrity and accuracy.
